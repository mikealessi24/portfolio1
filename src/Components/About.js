              I graduated from the College of Charleston in 2019 with a Bachelor
              of Science in Public Health. After graduation, I started to
              explore my passion for computer science and software development.
              I enrolled in a Charleston-based immersive coding bootcamp called
              Jack Russell Software (JRS) and began creating web applications.{" "}
